            <img src="images/profile.png" alt="Portrait of Nicolas DOYEN" width="200" height="200" />
            <p>
                I grew up moving across the west, south, and east of France, 
                learning to adapt quickly, listen first, and value different 
                perspectives
                <br/>
                For over a decade, I worked in people care and 
                education—supporting adolescents with disabilities, 
                coordinating programs for children and seniors, 
                and helping teams create safe, welcoming spaces.
                <br/>
                These experiences shaped my approach: start with empathy, 
                clarify needs, and build practical, human-centered solutions.
                <br/>
                Becoming a parent of two while completing Holberton School 
                strengthened my bias for ownership and discipline.
                I balanced an intensive curriculum with family 
                responsibilities, contributing to a culture of mutual support.
                This journey also led me to co-create 
                <strong>careConnect</strong>, a platform 
                inspired by my wife’s idea and our shared experience in the 
                medico-social field—connecting people with disabilities to 
                freelance professionals in a dignified, accessible way.
                <br>
                Earlier in my career, I launched an intergenerational program 
                pairing teens with seniors for projects like story recording, 
                beginner tech help, and creative workshops. It reduced 
                isolation, built confidence, and created a genuine sense of 
                belonging across generations.
                <br>
                Today, I bring the discipline of a caregiver, the curiosity of 
                a self-taught learner, and the builder’s mindset I’ve refined 
                through software engineering. My goal is to design systems 
                that help people belong and succeed—by lowering barriers, 
                clarifying expectations, and amplifying positive connections.
